## Why this Playground?

Creating your first bot/AI on CodinGame can be daunting, even scary for some. A lot of great developers have told me they didn't know anything about AI/bot programming and that they were not sure they were good enough to start...

Let me tell you something.

**If you know the basics of programming, you can write bots.**

It's not a part of programming reserved for the elites or something. _You can write bots._

Let me guide you!

## What's Bot Programming on CodinGame?

Bot programming on CodinGame takes the form of multiplayer games where you write a program that is able to play a game. Once submitted into the arena, your bot is matched against hundreds of other bots and you get a rank accordingly.

Your program "plays" the game by reading the data sent by CodinGame on the Standard Input Stream and sending a command on the Standard Output Stream at every turn of the game until there is a winner or a end condition is met.

The game is divided into several leagues. You start in the Wood leagues with a simplified version of the game. When ranking up, you'll be promoted to new leagues: Bronze, Silver, Gold and finally Legend.

## Getting Started

I've chosen [Ghost in the Cell](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/ghost-in-the-cell) because it's simple enough and quite fun. Let's see how fast we can get to the Bronze league. I'd say it'll take you 30 minutes, maximum an hour.

I personally code in Java but the tutorial is pretty language-agnostic. So choose your favorite language in the drop-down above the code and let's get cracking!

_Disclaimer: this tutorial aims at showing how easy and straightforward it can be to get started into a bot programming game. There are plenty of classic algorithms to use in bot programming, however it's not the focus of this tutorial._
