- Not reading all input (as provided in the default code) will most likely break your code. Even if you don't use the input, read it. Always.
- Make sure to send only one output per turn. In this game, the output can be made of multiple `MOVE` commands, but they need to be on the same line, separated by `;`.
- Some clever but difficult to implement ideas can be counter-productive. You'll spend time implementing them without being sure of the return on investment. Focus on the simplest ideas with the most probable effects.
- Don't worry about the performance of your code until you reach the Gold league. And even then, if you don't simulate possible moves, you probably don't need to worry.
- Don't modify your code to counter specific strategies unless a lot of bots used them. If you beat the boss 80% of the time but lose 80% of the time versus all other bots, you'll never get promoted.
