## Classic mistakes

- Not reading all input (as provided in the default code) will break your code.
- Make sure to output one command per turn (in this game, one command can be made of multiple moves if they're separated by ";")
- Some clever but difficult to implement can be counter-productive. You'll spend time implementing them for an unsure return on investment
